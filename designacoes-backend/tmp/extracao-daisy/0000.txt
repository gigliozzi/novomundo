    If you're reading this, it likely means your
    operating system has unpacked the ZIP file
    and is showing you its contents.  While it
    is possible to extract recordings and text
    this way, it is better to send the whole ZIP
    to a DAISY reader so that its recordings and
    text can be connected with each other.  If
    you are using EasyReader on a mobile device,
    close this file and navigate up a level to
    find the original ZIP file so it can be sent
    to EasyReader as a whole.  Some other DAISY
    readers need to be pointed at the OPF file
    instead, or at the whole directory/folder.
